Using a callback, you could call the calculator function (myCalculator) with a callback (myCallback),
and let the calculator function run the callback after the calculation is finished:


When to Use a Callback?
The examples above are not very exciting.

They are simplified to teach you the callback syntax.

Where callbacks really shine are in asynchronous functions, where one function has to wait for another function (like waiting for a file to load).

Asynchronous functions are covered in the next chapter.
